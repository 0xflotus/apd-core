description: The National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRS) is a network of 29 reserves protected for long-term research, ecosystem monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship. Established by the Coastal Zone Management Act, the reserve system is a partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states. NOAA provides funding, national guidance, and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on daily basis by a lead state agency or university with input from local partners. These data are collected as part of the reserve's System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), which includes (1) abiotic indicators of water quality and weather; (2) biological monitoring; and (3) watershed, habitat, and land use mapping. Meteorological data provide information on atmospheric conditions that can affect water quality and biological and physical processes. Core elements currently measured at each National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) include air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).  Optional parameters include total solar radiation. Each site maintains at least one meteorological station. Stations are placed at locations typical of local conditions or in areas where a specific need for weather data has been identified. Data are reported at 15 minute intervals. Prior to 2007, hourly and daily average data were also reported. Water quality observations made over long time periods, and can provide important feedback to scientists and to local, state, and national resource managers about actions taken to manage, protect, and restore estuaries. They also provide valuable information for evaluating the impacts of environmental change on coastal habitats and species. There are at least four water quality stations at each National Estuarine Research Reserve. Each station is designed to characterize long-term variability and short term changes in environmental conditions. Data are collected with data loggers at fifteen minute intervals and instruments are deployed continuously and year round where possible. Water quality parameters collected include water temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, depth, and turbidity.  Chlorohpyll fluorescence is an optional parameter and pressure corrected water depth is a calculated value. Discrete samples for nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations are also collected at each long-term monitoring station at least once monthly. More intensive (24-hours over a complete tidal cycle) sampling is conducted each month at one water quality monitoring station to better understand impacts of tide and irradiance on nutrient cycling.  Nutrient parameters collected include nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and chlorophyll a. Numerous optional parameters include dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen, and total dissolved phosphorous. Data ownership/liability.  The National Estuarine Research Reserve retains the right to be fully credited for having collected and process the data.  Following academic courtesy standards, the reserve site where the data were collected should be contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any part of the data are used.  These data sets are only as good as the quality assurance and quality control procedures outlined by the enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for its subsequent use or misuse in any further analyses or comparisons.  The federal government does not assume liability to the recipient or third persons, nor will the federal government reimburse or indemnify the recipient for its liability due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.
