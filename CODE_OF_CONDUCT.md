# Code of Conduct

The AwesomeData community consists primarily, although not solely, of its online presence in mailing lists and activities such as the blog postings and comments, the GitHub repository, and so on. The vision of AwesomeData community is contributing a pure list of `high quality` datasets for open communities like academics, research, education etc.

The following conduct policy is a guideline to propose new data items and maintain existing items with outdated information:

1. A dataset is considered as `high quality` when one of or multiple following criteria are met:
    * Uncommon to obtain in the open community legally;
    * Contributing valuable knowledge for a specific domain;
    * Able to be downloaded directly from the targeted site, i.e., not banned by login or purchasing;
    * No advertisement! No Spam! No reputation promotion!

2. A new pull request will be merged into the core repository after passing automatic validation and maintainer's review.

3. An existing dataset item with outdated information (e.g., unavailable site) will be removed after a while without new update.
