# CONTRIBUTING

The AwesomeData community consists primarily, although not solely, of its online presence in mailing lists and activities such as blog postings and comments, the GitHub repository, and so on. The vision of the AwesomeData community is contributing a pure list of `high quality` datasets for open communities such as academia, research, education etc.

The following policy is a guideline to propose new data items and maintain existing items with outdated information:

1. A dataset is considered as `high quality` when one or more of the following criteria are met:
    * Uncommon to obtain in the open community legally;
    * Contributing valuable knowledge for a specific domain;
    * Able to be downloaded directly from the linked site, i.e., not barred by login or purchasing;
    * No advertisement! No Spam! No reputation promotion!

2. A new pull request will be merged into the core repository after passing automatic validation and maintainer's review.

3. An existing dataset item with outdated information (e.g., unavailable site) will be removed after a while without new update.
